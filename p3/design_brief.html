	<h1>DESIGN BRIEF:</h1><br><p>As a passionate young designer, the “hire me” and “reputation building” portfolios would suit me best. The portfolio website is to showcase my best work and will include brief descriptions for each of them. The resume should be found either in the portfolio page or the contact page.  The resume will be in PDF form. I also want it to be easy to navigate throughout the website. The loading of the website should load in a reasonable time. Typography choices should match the feel of the website as well as the color choices.<br>
	
	The target audience is for graphic designers, video editors (post-production) and photographers. I would also like my portfolio to get the attention of people who aren’t in the graphic design world.<br>
	
	I want the design to represent me as a person and appeal the audience. My goal is that when professionals view my portfolio, they would want to hire me. I also want my work to inspire others to achieve their passions.<br>
	
	I need to design a website that is doable for coding. I need to remember when I’m designing to not overdo the effects.<br>
	
	The final portfolio website should consist of easy navigational links and loading to be reasonable time. The links should be working.</p>
