	<h1>Portfoilio Critique for Project 3</h1>
	
	
<h2>Danny Jones<br><br>
	<a href="http://yasly.com/work/"><img src="img/YASLY.PNG" alt="Danny Jones" style="width:600px;height:300px;"></a>
	</h2>

	<p>Danny has a very simple layout and to the point. He has a lot of different types of designs to look through. When you click on the about tab it takes you to his contact place and a few important facts about him. I like that he added his own profile so the people hiring him or the clients get to see what he looks like. When you click on the Behance tab it opens another browser tab and shows you more of his work. His navigation bar is very well organized and his logo is at the top left corner. However, he hasn't updated it since 2016.</p>

	

<h2>Amber Xu<br><br>

	<p>This website portfolio is very unique. I really love the small fact about the artist in the beginning. Once you scroll down the background changes to black. I'm a really big fan of a black background with either white or blue font color. Her color choices really fit with her designs. Her layout is simple and really manages to capture the viewers attention towards her designs.</p>

	

<h2>Heather Shaw<br><br>
	<a href="http://heathershaw.com/"><img src="img/HEATHERSHAW.PNG" alt="Heather Shaw" style="width:600px;height:300px;"></a></h2>

	<p>Heather really captures the simplicity of her layout. I like how the images are all shown to have a hover over them and once you move your mouse on top of an image you can then see the clearer picture. At the end theirs a short explanation about her and what she can help with. Her contact information is at the bottom and you can learn more about her.</p>



<h2>Nathan Riley<br><br>
	<a href="https://nrly.co/"><img src="img/NATHAN.PNG" alt="Nathan Riley" style="width:600px;height:300px;"></a></h2>

	<p>I first notice the smiley face and coming soon to be active when you move your mouse over it. Very creative. Once you click on"dribble" it takes you to another page with all of his designs. He does a lot of really cool animation. Really gets my attention. He has a twitter and an instagram for contact and he has a "Hey" tab to email him.</p>

	
<h2>Josh Miller<br><br>
	<a href="https://www.joshmiller.com.au/"><img src="img/JOSHMILLER.PNG" alt="Josh Miller" style="width:600px;height:300px;"></a></h2>

	<p>I love how the background is moving. The green in the background really fits with his layout and his font choices. Once you scroll down you see his main projects. Then if you click on the the contact tab it reloads the page and you can send him an email. He also has social media icons at the bottom of the page. He also updated his copyright at the bottom of the page. The transitions of the website is also very well made. It takes about 3 seconds or less to load. He also added a little bit about his work and what year it was created and for who.</p>
