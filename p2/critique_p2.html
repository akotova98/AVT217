	<h1>Restaurant Critique for Project 2</h1>
	
<h2>BarTaco<br><br>
	<a href="https://bartaco.com/"><img src="BarTaco Desktop and Phone.png" alt="BarTaco Desktop and Phone"></a></h2>

	<p>This restaurants website has a good color scheme overall and is very easy to look through. It has the home button, menu and locations, party tab, shop, orders, and a talk to us tab. The logo is white and at the top left corner. When you click on it, it takes you to the home page. At the home page when you scroll down there is a very sweet quote and images of the location. The colors are white, blue and some green for the tacos. At the bottom you see the social media icons. The navigation bar is to the point. I love the title of the home page “tacos and tequila”. Overall this restaurant supports the purpose of its site. I wouldn’t change a thing about it. Really gets my attention and the tacos look delicious. </p>

<h2>Bar Louie<br><br>
	<a href="https://www.barlouie.com/"><img src="Bar Louie Desktop and Phone.png" alt="Bar Louie Desktop and Phone"></a></h2>

	<p>This restaurant/bar color scheme is very dark compared to the previous restaurant. Bar Louie uses brown, black and red colors to represent their website. They have pictures of their mini slider burgers as well as other foods and cocktails. They have a good navigation bar with menu, locations, what’s new, gift cards and free spirits wanted. You have food and drink options in the menu tab and it’s easy to look through if you want to check them out before heading to the restaurant. They have plenty of choices to pick from and they all look delicious. It’s making me hungry just scrolling through this website. I’ve been to Bar Louie a couple of times and I’m a very big fan of their food. At the bottom of their website they have all of their social media at the left corner. I like their location tab because you can just enter your zip code and it’ll let you know the closest place near you.</p>

<h2>Red Lobster<br><br>
	<a href="https://www.redlobster.com/"><img src="Red Lobster Desktop and Phone.png" alt="Red Lobster Desktop and Phone"></a></h2>

	<p>Red Lobster has red, black and white as the main colors. The logo of the red lobster is at the top left corner. They have a navigation tab with order now, meu, specials, rewards, our story and gift cards. They also have a sign in and a basket at the right top corner. You put your zip code in and fine a location near you. At the menu tab you get a lot of choices from a lot of different categories to choose from. They have a very nice layout overall. If you click on the logo it returns you to the home page. They also have their social media at the bottom.</p>

<h2>Carrabba’s Italian Grill<br><br>
	<a href="https://www.carrabbas.com/"><img src="Carrabba's Italian Grill Desktop and Phone.png" alt="Carrabba's Italian Grill Desktop and Phone"></a></h2>

	<p>This restaurant has black, white and grey as the main colors. Their navigation tab text is a little bit too big for the desktop site. They have a home, menu, order now, catering, gift cards, offers and wait list. You can get a pickup or a delivery. When you scroll down, they have a lot of events going on and what foods they will be serving at those events. When I go to their menu page their layout is a little bit too scatters around. I’m not sure where to look first. They have the location option just above the menu options. The food looks delicious though, especially the spaghetti.</p>

<h2>Ann's Pizza<br><br>
	<a href="https://annspizzaenfield.com/"><img src="Ann's Pizza Desktop and Phone.png" alt="Ann's Pizza Desktop and Phone"></a></h2>

	<p>Ann’s Pizza has white, black and red color scheme. The navigation bar is all the way at the top middle, and it has, store hours, our menu, feedback and contact. You can also order online and check the hours. They have their social media at the bottom of their website. It’s simple and to the point navigation. Unfortunately, their menu only shows the names of the food but no images which I don’t really like. I’d like to see what the food I’ll order looks like.</p>
